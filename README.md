About the Dataset
This dataset provides comprehensive data on used vehicles, including features that impact pricing. It can be leveraged for various machine learning tasks, such as predicting vehicle prices. The dataset is particularly suitable for linear regression examples in machine learning.

Dataset Columns:
Name: The model and make of the vehicle.
Year: The manufacturing year of the vehicle.
Selling_Price: The price at which the car is being sold (target variable).
Km_Driven: The distance the vehicle has been driven, measured in kilometers.
Fuel: The type of fuel used by the vehicle (e.g., Petrol, Diesel).
Seller_Type: Indicates whether the seller is a dealer or an individual.
Transmission: The type of transmission (Manual or Automatic).
Owner: The number of previous owners.
Objectives:
Price Prediction: Utilize machine learning models like Linear Regression to predict the selling price based on the vehicle's features.
Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand how different factors influence vehicle prices.
Model Comparison: Compare multiple machine learning models to determine the best approach for price prediction.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing data, perform feature encoding, and manage outliers.
Tools and Libraries:
Pandas: For data cleaning and manipulation.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
